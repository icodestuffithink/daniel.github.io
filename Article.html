        Before I start the review, id like to highlight that this isn't an 'I think x is bad/overrated and so should you' website. This is simply my reasoning for dropping the show at episode 5.
      </p>/
      <p>
        Firstly, there is the entire reason I'm an anime fan in the first place. Animation is capable of conveying emotions in a way that live action doesn't. BGS however, uses the medium for one visually interesting scene in the first 5 episodes. Apart from this, there were no shots that i find even remotely interesting to look at, with directing that feels flat to me and character animation that fails to convince me of genuine feelings.
      </p>/

        Good visuals aren't everything though and good stories don't necessitate impressive visuals to keep me engaged. Unfortunately, there are several aspects of Bunny Girl's plot and execution that didn't gel well with me. Most importantly, the solutions of Bunny Girl's supernatural problems aren't very compelling. Both Mai and Koga get saved from their problems by Sakuta and I don't like that. I find stories of how they overcome their problems much more engaging than a love confession and Sakuta beating a guy up (I know that's not the actual conclusion but, from what i heard the conclusion is even worse). At the end of the first arc, I asked myself: what have the characters learnt from this, how have they changed, what is the lesson? None of the answers I or people I've talked to satisfy me.
      </p>/
      <p>
        The pacing of the story also seems fairly rushed, as if it's jumping from plot point to plot point with no time for anything to impact me, particularly when Sakuta talks about his sister's syndrome it shows the only visually interesting scene in the anime and then goes back to what they were talking about earlier which was fairly jarring. I felt a slower pace to allow for more characterisation would have benefited the anime.
      </p>/

        Another problem I have with the anime is with the pseudo-science. This often gets brushed off as one of Futaba's character traits even but, there is no indication that Futaba is the person who doesn't know what she's talking about and not the author. If I knew nothing about quantum physics then there is no clue that Futaba is misapplying the theories - there should be a better clue than Futaba just being wrong. It also doesn't help that her characterisation up to the point i dropped it is 'science girl', so it's a fair assumption that she's the author's tool for exposition.

          This leads me on to my next issue: the characters.

        Futaba is an extremely boring character with seemingly no depth (I've read about her later development and it's very much a case of "why would i care about the problems of a drawing that I didn't like in the first place"). She has a crush on a guy we know hardly anything about (that's already an overdone cliche) and that's everything.

        Kuninimi (I think?) Is a bro, a one-dimensional bro that doesn't even have his name on Bunny Girl's MAL page or any real screen time but he's cool.His girlfriend is annoying for the sake of it.Similarly annoying is Koga who happens to be the kind of person I really don't like, so it was always going to be a task to get me to like her anyway.

        Sakura himself is relatively smart, charismatic, witty, a nice guy, apparently good in a fight, gives great life advice, is smooth with the ladies, works part-time to help support himself and his sister, is the sole caretaker for his sister and lacks any convincing flaws that make him seem human to me. The story seems to be afraid to question his views and expose any insecurities or weaknesses he has. I've been told that he later gets called out on his behaviour but, the story hasn't given any consequences for this.A good writer, in my opinion, should put a character in a situation where we can see these parts of their personalities.

         Mai is an Ok character. She's a tsundere pretending to be a kuudere but, there really isn't enough to sell me on her character. For instance, how did she feel when her mother forgot she exists? How does she feel about it now
      </p>/

      <p>
There are also two other aspects that fail to move me in this show. The OST exists, probably, I can't remember any of the music. Then there's the voice acting. I just don't like how monotone it is. It makes any lines that aren't best suited to monotone like sarcastic comebacks either sound boring or lacking in emotion.
